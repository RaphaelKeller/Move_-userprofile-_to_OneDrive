# Move_-userprofile-_to_OneDrive
This script moves all known Folders to OneDrive and changes the path to the new Folder.

You can change the variable PCSync to what you think is best for you. But you have to Change it everywhere in the script since i did not 
write a variable for it. feel free to do that.

The mklink I wrote in the first script "onedrive_sync.bat" is there to hide the status display from Onedrive Sync on the desktop.

OneDrive will automatically mark the Folder Documents and Pictures as Saved as Backup even if they are not in the Root of the %ONEDRIVE% Folder.
you can see what i mean here in German:
