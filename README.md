# Move_-userprofile-_to_OneDrive
This Script moves all known Folders to OneDrive and changes the path to the new Folder.
You can change the variable PCSync to what you think is best for you.

The mklink I wrote in the first script is there to hide the status display from Onedrive Sync on the desktop.
